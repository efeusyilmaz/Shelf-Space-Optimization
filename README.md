# Fitting-Shelves-Problem

  Shelf space maximisation is one of key factors behind any marketing strategy for a brand. In this article, I will explain some challenges in shelf space optimization and then solve an example using python. 
  
Optimization is the science / process behind finding the best solution for a problem with given constraints. We basically take a real world problem, model it mathematically and then solve it using mathematical techniques with in the constraints. Optimization is useful in Marketing, Manufacturing, Finance, Online advertising, Machine Learning and all fields you can imagine.

  Shelf Space Optimization
  
In a store, a productâ€™s position in store can greatly affect its performance. Having the right space allocation for products and categories plays a critical role in its retail success. From retailers perspective, given the value of shelf space positions, it is very critical to ensure that retail space is working for value maximization for the store.

The shelves near the POS offer maximum visibility to the customers and help the stores reap in those extra few dollars for items which were not even in the shoppers list. Marketing the right merchandise, at the right place, at the right time, in the right quantities is key to retail revenues and profitability. This has led to a war between brands to occupy the best possible space in a store. On the other hand, the stores also have to optimize their overall profitability considering the sales of all merchandise.

  The task is to place products into the fixture, maximizing product profit under problem constraints:
-    there must be either zero or one of each product on the shelves
-   shelf capacity constraint the sum of the product widths must not exceed the shelf width
